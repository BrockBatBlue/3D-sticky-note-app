# Mind Palace 3D Note Taking App

This app is a mind palace-esque note taking app. You can place notes in parts of the house that are relevant to the reminder. The house has all the necessary rooms:

1. Kitchen - think recipes, dinner reminders, outings with friends, and whatever you might stick on your refrigerator as a reminder.
2. Living room - sticky notes can be placed anywhere, so think of that show you want to start with friends or your partner, movie night ideas, gaming ideas, relaxation-focused reminders. That sort of thing.
3. Office - oh anything work related or hobby related ðŸ˜€
4. Bedroom - Finally getting that super sensitive sleep app, or getting that sunrise alarm clock, or putting a bedtime reminder sticky note.
5. Bathroom - Getting that serum you wanted to try, reminder for self care, bath bombs! 6. Reading room - Starting a book club, researching a topic, enjoying personal time.

You can use sticky notes for all sorts of things, any of the above mentioned, none of the above, it's yours to enjoy.

## How it works

The Note Taking App is pretty simple.

You just left click to the area in the house you want to get to, move your mouse to the spot you want to add a sticky note and right click to create that sticky note. It will be placed then, so you need to left click on it to open it and write your reminder.

## Inside your sticky note:

You will have a text box to write your reminder

You will have an optional due date to add to your reminder

You will have a save button to save all your changes to the sticky note

You will have a close button to close out of your sticky note

You will have a delete reminder button

You will have a finished button to log your finished tasks

## Once you are finished with a task or reminder

You can click your sticky note to get into the sticky note UI, then click finished. This will start a "finished" celebration animation, which will then move your task into a finished tasks folder. Enjoy! You can go back and see your finished tasks whenever you like. As long as you save your app.

## Saving and loading your app

Just like in a video game, even if you save something inside of the app, your app as a whole must also be saved.

Just press F5 for save when you are ready to close your app. This will save all of your changes.

When you want to load your last save, just click the load button in the opening app UI
